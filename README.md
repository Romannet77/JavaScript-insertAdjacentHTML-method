This is a small project about creating HTML elements using insertAdjacentHTML() method with explanations and examples.

In my opinion, the insertAdjacentHTML() is the best method to create HTML elements in JavaScript language.

The project shows the simplicity and effectiveness of the method and I hope that it will be useful for every Web Developer.
